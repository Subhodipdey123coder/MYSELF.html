   <p style="font: Agency FB;">My name is Subhodip Dey. My name is Saira and I live in Durgapur, West Bengal. I was born in Raniganj. I joined my School and made lots of friends. They are very helpful ade friendly.

    At school, the teachers tought me a lot of knowledge wchich helps me in my life and also my study.
    
    We participated in all the activities of the school and enjoyed our school days.I am basically an extrovert person and so I make friends very easily. I have so many friends and we all enjoy a lot. I visit their homes and they also visit my home. I also like drawing and painting and playing outdoor games like volleyball and badminton.

    At school we have the coaching for these and so it makes it easy for me to learn well, these sport activities. During my free time, I draw pictures and paint them. I have done three four paintings that have been put up at my home.
    
    Apart from these activities, I also like reading and playing indoor games. Detective novels are what I like the best now and have a great collection on them. Drawing is something I enjoy and so I make a lot of paintings which helps me to remember the childish deys.
